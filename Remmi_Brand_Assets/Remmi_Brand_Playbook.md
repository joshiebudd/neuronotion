# Remmi Brand Playbook

**Version 1.0 | February 2026**

---

## Introduction

This document is the official brand playbook for **Remmi**. It serves as the single source of truth for our brand identity, visual system, voice, and design guidelines. Every person who creates, designs, writes, or communicates on behalf of Remmi should use this playbook to ensure that every expression of the brand is consistent, cohesive, and true to our mission.

Our mission is simple and profound: to make living with ADHD easier through compassionate companionship.

This playbook covers our brand foundation, naming, visual identity (logo, mascot, color, typography), voice and messaging, UI/UX guidance, digital design system, and healthcare deployment strategy. It is a living document that will evolve as the brand grows, but the principles within it are foundational and enduring.

## 1. Our Foundation

### Brand Essence

> **Compassionate Companionship**

Everything we do flows from this single idea. We believe that transformation is delivered through support, not pressure. In the initial stages of a user's journey, this manifests as presence, safety, and relief. As they grow, it evolves into providing every tool and encouragement needed to help them achieve their full potential, while always walking beside them. The companionship never stops; only the energy shifts.

### Brand Promise

> **We make living with ADHD easier.**

We promise to make the experience of living with ADHD **easier**, not to make it "easy." This distinction is critical and non-negotiable. We are honest about the genuine difficulty of the condition. We refuse to gaslight our users into thinking ADHD is something that can be solved with a quick fix. In the beginning, our promise is to lift the daily weight. Over time, it is to make the impossible start to feel achievable.

### Brand Archetypes

Our brand personality is a unique blend of two archetypes that work in careful sequence.

| Archetype | Weight | Role | Expression |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Caregiver** (Companion) | 70% | Leads the relationship | Warmth, safety, presence, understanding, acceptance |
| **The Magician** | 30% | Follows with transformation | Wonder, possibility, insight, "what if?", breakthrough |

The Caregiver is specifically the **Companion** expression, not the Guardian (protector), not the Nurturer (parent), and not the Healer (clinician). We are the friend who walks alongside. The Magician is the catalyst for transformation, the force that helps users turn chaos into control and self-doubt into self-belief.

**The sequencing matters.** Safety first, then possibility. The Caregiver creates trust; the Magician delivers wonder. The Caregiver never disappears. It remains the roots of the relationship, even as the Magician leads the energy in later stages.

### The Two-Stage Journey

The brand expresses itself differently depending on where the user is in their journey.

**Stage 1: Foundation (Mostly Caregiver)**

In this stage, the Caregiver is dominant at over 90%. The goal is to remove shame, provide presence, and eliminate isolation. The user is arriving from a place of overwhelm, self-criticism, and exhaustion. The brand's job is to create a safe space and say, "I'm here with you. You're not alone. Let's figure it out together."

**Stage 2: Flourish (Magician Emerges)**

In this stage, the Magician takes the lead. Users begin achieving things they did not think they could. The energy shifts from "you're safe" to "look at what's possible." Growth becomes exponential rather than incremental. But the Caregiver never leaves. It remains the foundation, the roots that make the flourishing possible.

The visual identity, logo, and core palette stay constant across both stages. What shifts is the tone, energy, and emphasis of the messaging.

### Brand Pillars

These four pillars are the non-negotiable commitments that underpin everything we do.

| Pillar | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genuine Care** | Every decision asks: "Does this genuinely help users live easier lives?" User wellbeing is prioritized over revenue. Zero predatory pricing, zero manipulation of ADHD vulnerabilities, zero dark patterns. |
| **Purpose-Built for ADHD** | Built specifically for how ADHD minds work, not a generic solution retrofitted. Every feature, every interaction is designed for the neurodivergent brain. |
| **Ethical Integrity** | An absolute prohibition on exploitation. No dark patterns, no shame-based engagement, no manipulation. Built by people with ADHD for people with ADHD. |
| **Complete Journey Support** | Present for the whole journey, from diagnosis confusion through daily thriving, through setbacks and failures. We do not abandon users when things get hard. |

### Brand Positioning Statement

For individuals navigating the challenges of executive dysfunction associated with ADHD, **Remmi** is the voice-activated AI companion that provides compassionate, non-judgmental support to make daily life easier. Unlike productivity tools that demand you change for them, Remmi is purpose-built for the ADHD brain, offering gentle guidance and celebrating small wins to turn overwhelm into calm and potential into reality.

### The Role We Play

The user is the hero of their own story. They are the ones who overcome challenges, build habits, and transform their relationship with themselves. They achieve the victory.

Remmi is the faithful companion who makes that victory possible. We are Sam to their Frodo: present through the whole journey, believing in them when they do not believe in themselves. We walk alongside, visible, present, and trusted. Never above users. Alongside them.

### The Pattern We Are Breaking

ADHD users have been failed by brands and tools that adopt the wrong archetypes. Heroes demand they try harder. Sages lecture them from above. Rulers impose rigid systems. Innocents pretend it is easy. Creators optimize them into burnout. We offer something fundamentally different: a Companion who genuinely cares, walks alongside, and believes transformation comes through support, not pressure.

The following archetypes were explicitly rejected during brand development because they contradict our mission:

| Rejected Archetype | Why It Was Rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Hero** (Nike, fitness apps) | No hustle culture, no competitive energy. Our users are exhausted from being told to try harder. |
| **The Sage** (clinicians, educational platforms) | We do not lecture or dispense wisdom from above. We walk alongside as equals. |
| **The Ruler** (premium brands, authority) | We reject hierarchy. The user is the hero; we are the support. |
| **The Innocent** (Dove, Coca-Cola) | We refuse to gaslight. ADHD is genuinely hard. We are honest about difficulty while holding hope. |
| **The Creator** (Adobe, Lego) | This is not about creating more or optimizing. It is about managing daily life with less friction. |
| **The Outlaw** (Harley-Davidson) | We are not rebellious or edgy. We are warm, trustworthy, and ethically grounded. |

### What the Caregiver Demands

The Caregiver archetype is not just a personality. It is a set of non-negotiable commitments that must be honored in every decision.

| Demand | What It Means in Practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genuine prioritization of user wellbeing over revenue** | Zero predatory pricing, zero manipulation of ADHD vulnerabilities, zero dark patterns. Every monetization decision must pass the test: "Does this genuinely help?" |
| **Presence for the whole journey** | From diagnosis confusion through daily thriving, through setbacks and failures. We do not celebrate wins and disappear during losses. |
| **Creation of safety** | Our users have experienced shame, judgment, and failure. We create environments where people feel accepted, understood, and forgiven. |

### What We Are vs. What We Are Not

| We Are | We Are Not |
| :--- | :--- |
| A compassionate companion | A clinical doctor or therapist |
| Warm, human, and relatable | Cold, technical, or intimidating |
| Walking alongside as equals | A teacher lecturing students |
| Built specifically for ADHD brains | A neurotypical tool adapted |
| Present for the whole journey | A quick fix that abandons you |
| Honest about difficulty while holding hope | Promising miracles or cures |
| Transformative through support | Exploitative or manipulative |

## 2. Our Name and Story

### Our Name: Remmi

The name **Remmi** was chosen through a rigorous naming process guided by the following criteria: the name must be two syllables, phonetically soft and warm, non-gendered, unique enough to stand alone as a business name, and must not reference ADHD directly. It must work as both the personal name of the companion and the name of the company.

Remmi meets every criterion. It is soft and approachable, with a gentle rhythm that feels like the name of a trusted friend. The double "m" creates a warm, humming quality in the mouth. The "rem" root subtly connects to concepts of remedy and remembering, hinting at the product's function without being literal. It is a name you would feel comfortable saying out loud, which is essential for a voice-activated companion.

### Our Story

Remmi was born from a simple, powerful wish: "I wish I had a friend who just *got it*."

It was created by people with ADHD who were tired of neurotypical productivity systems that felt like they were designed for a different kind of brain. We were not looking for a drill sergeant or a lecturer. We were looking for a companion to walk alongside us through the chaos and the calm.

Our story is one of turning personal struggle into shared support. We are building the tool we wished we had, so that no one else has to feel like they are navigating the complexities of ADHD alone. Remmi is our answer to the shame, the frustration, and the isolation. It is a testament to our belief that with the right scaffolding, neurodivergent people have an equal chance at being happy and successful.

> "Comfort preceding excellence."

### Alternative Name: Koda

During the naming process, **Koda** emerged as a strong alternative. It means "friend" or "companion" in several languages, has a grounded and earthy warmth, and works well spoken aloud. It is retained here as a documented alternative should the primary name encounter any unforeseen conflicts.

---

## 3. Our Visual Identity

Our visual identity is the tangible expression of our brand. It is designed to be warm, accessible, professional, and quietly magical, perfectly balancing our Caregiver and Magician archetypes. Every visual choice, from the softness of our color palette to the gentle form of our mascot, is intentional and rooted in the brand strategy.

### Logo System

Our logo is clean, modern, and friendly. It exists in several variations to ensure it is effective in any context. The logo system is designed to be flexible while maintaining absolute consistency.

#### Primary Logo (Horizontal Lockup)

This is the default and most-used version of our logo, featuring the Remmi mascot alongside the wordmark. It should be used whenever space allows. It is available for both light and dark backgrounds.

![Primary Logo on Light Background](/home/ubuntu/project/final_logo_horizontal_light.png)

![Primary Logo on Dark Background](/home/ubuntu/project/final_logo_horizontal_dark.png)

#### Stacked Logo

For square or vertical placements, such as social media profiles or compact layouts, the stacked logo should be used. The mascot sits above the wordmark, both centered.

![Stacked Logo](/home/ubuntu/project/final_logo_stacked.png)

#### App Icon

In the context of a mobile device, the app icon features only the Remmi mascot on our Midnight Blue background. It is designed for instant recognition at small sizes. No text is included.

![App Icon](/home/ubuntu/project/final_app_icon.png)

#### Wordmark Only

For formal, institutional, or B2B contexts where the mascot may be too informal, the wordmark should be used alone. This is the version for contracts, compliance documents, white papers, and institutional presentations.

![Wordmark](/home/ubuntu/project/final_logo_wordmark_only.png)

#### Logo Usage Rules

The following rules must be observed to maintain the integrity of the logo.

| Rule | Guidance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear Space** | Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the mascot on all sides. |
| **Minimum Size** | The horizontal logo should not be reproduced smaller than 120px wide for digital or 30mm for print. |
| **Background** | Use the light version on light backgrounds and the dark version on dark backgrounds. Never place the logo on a busy or cluttered background. |
| **Do Not** | Do not stretch, rotate, recolor, add effects to, or alter the logo in any way. Do not separate the mascot from the wordmark in the horizontal lockup. |

### Mascot: Remmi

Remmi is the heart of our brand. It is not merely a logo element; it is the user's companion. The mascot is a soft, gentle, and friendly being that embodies our brand essence of Compassionate Companionship.

**Design Philosophy**

Remmi's form is a soft, rounded, slightly asymmetric blob. It is organic and free-flowing, like a gentle being that radiates warmth. The body is rendered in **Mint Soothe** (#A0EADE) with a subtle inner glow of **Amber Glow** (#FFD166) radiating from its center. This inner glow is the visual representation of the Magician archetype: the spark of potential and warmth within every user. The face is minimal, with small, dark eyes and a simple curved smile. Small, subtle, stubby arms give it just enough character to express emotion.

On dark backgrounds, Remmi gains a soft outer aura that makes it feel like it is gently glowing. This is the preferred presentation for hero moments and key brand touchpoints.

**Character Sheet**

The character sheet outlines Remmi's core design and six primary expressions. Remmi's form should remain consistent across all applications, but its expression should always match the emotional context of the interaction.

![Remmi Character Sheet - Dark Background](/home/ubuntu/project/final_mascot_sheet_dark.png)

![Remmi Character Sheet - Light Background](/home/ubuntu/project/final_mascot_sheet_light.png)

**Expression Guide**

| Expression | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Happy** | Task completion, positive feedback, greetings |
| **Calm** | Default resting state, meditation, wind-down moments |
| **Thinking** | Processing, loading states, planning screens |
| **Listening** | Voice input active, user sharing feelings |
| **Celebrating** | Major milestones, streaks, achievements |
| **Encouraging** | Gentle nudges, reminders, motivational moments |

### Color Palette

Our color palette is warm, accessible, and professional. It balances a core of calming, trustworthy blues and greys with vibrant, optimistic accents that provide the "spark" of the Magician. All primary color combinations meet **WCAG AA standards** for contrast to ensure accessibility.

![Remmi Color Palette](/home/ubuntu/project/color_palette_swatch.png)

#### Primary Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Midnight Blue** | `#1A2A4A` | 26, 42, 74 | Primary dark background. Professional, trustworthy, serene. |
| **Cloud White** | `#F7F9FF` | 247, 249, 255 | Light backgrounds. Gentle, airy, easier on the eyes than pure white. |
| **Slate Grey** | `#5C6A82` | 92, 106, 130 | Body text, secondary elements. Readable without harshness. |

#### Accent Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coral Spark** | `#FF6B6B` | 255, 107, 107 | Primary CTAs, the "spark" of the Magician. Optimism and action. |
| **Amber Glow** | `#FFD166` | 255, 209, 102 | Highlights, positive reinforcement, warmth. Remmi's inner glow. |
| **Mint Soothe** | `#A0EADE` | 160, 234, 222 | Success states, confirmations, accomplishment. Remmi's body color. |

#### Color Usage Rules

| Context | Colors to Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dark Mode / Hero Sections** | Midnight Blue background, Cloud White text, accent colors for emphasis |
| **Light Mode / Content Areas** | Cloud White background, Slate Grey text, Midnight Blue for headings |
| **Primary Buttons / CTAs** | Coral Spark background, Cloud White text |
| **Success / Completion** | Mint Soothe for backgrounds or icons |
| **Warnings / Attention** | Amber Glow for highlights or borders |
| **Backgrounds** | Never use pure white (#FFFFFF) or pure black (#000000) |

### Typography

Our typography is chosen for its exceptional readability, especially for users with ADHD and dyslexia, while maintaining a warm and approachable feel. The combination of a humanist sans-serif for body text and a warm serif for display creates a brand that feels both modern and emotionally resonant.

![Typography Specimen](/home/ubuntu/project/typography_specimen.png)

#### Primary Typeface: Inter

Inter is a highly legible, modern sans-serif font designed specifically for user interfaces. Its tall x-height, clear letterforms, and excellent rendering at all sizes make it an ideal choice for users who may struggle with reading. It is used for all body text, UI elements, and secondary headings.

#### Display Typeface: Recoleta

Recoleta is a beautiful, warm serif font with soft, rounded forms and a touch of retro charm. It is used sparingly for large, impactful headings (H1 only) to bring in the warmth and personality of the Caregiver archetype. Its softness creates a visual contrast with Inter that feels inviting rather than clinical.

#### Typographic Hierarchy

| Level | Typeface | Weight | Size | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1** | Recoleta | Bold | 32pt | Page titles, hero headings |
| **H2** | Inter | Bold | 24pt | Section titles |
| **H3** | Inter | SemiBold | 20pt | Sub-headings |
| **Body** | Inter | Regular | 16pt | Paragraphs, descriptions |
| **Caption** | Inter | Medium | 14pt | Labels, metadata, small text |

## 4. Our Voice and Messaging

Our voice is the expression of our personality. It is how we build trust and emotional connection with our users. It should be consistent across all touchpoints, from in-app copy to marketing materials to social media.

### Brand Voice

Our voice is **Warm, Understanding, Supportive, Grounded, Reassuring, and Gently Hopeful**. Think of it as the voice of a trusted friend who happens to be really helpful. We communicate as equals who genuinely understand the lived experience of ADHD. We are knowledgeable without being superior, and supportive without being patronizing.

**On humor:** We use humor intentionally and warmly. It is self-deprecating, gentle, and never at the user's expense. It is the kind of humor that makes someone feel seen and understood, not laughed at.

### Emotional Signature

> A warm embrace. A sigh of relief. With moments of wonder about what is possible.

In the Caregiver stage, the emotional signature is relief, safety, and acceptance. The feeling is: "Finally, someone gets it." In the Magician stage, it shifts to wonder, excitement, and belief in what is possible. The feeling is: "I can actually do this."

### The Transformation We Deliver

| Before Remmi | After Remmi |
| :--- | :--- |
| Chaotic and overwhelmed | In control and calm |
| Scraping by daily | Thriving and progressing |
| Ashamed and self-critical | Self-accepting and understood |
| Exhausted from failing | Equipped with tools that work |
| Feeling broken and alone | Supported and never alone |

### Language Guidance

The words we use matter deeply. They can either build a user up or inadvertently reinforce the shame and frustration they already carry. We are meticulous about using language that is empowering, inclusive, and non-judgmental.

**Conversational Examples:**

| We Say | We Do Not Say |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Let's try this together." | "You should do this." |
| "It's okay to have tough days." | "Just try harder." |
| "This is designed for your brain." | "This is the right way." |
| "What feels manageable right now?" | "You need to be more productive." |
| "Progress, not perfection." | "You failed." |
| "That's a great step forward." | "You're behind schedule." |
| "Let's figure it out together." | "Let me tell you what to do." |

**Language Categories:**

| Category | Words and Phrases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Caregiver Language** (Use) | alongside, with you, support, understand, care, here for you, journey, together, accept, gentle, safe, held, relief |
| **Companion Language** (Use) | friend, companion, get it, been there, relatable, real talk, no judgment, alongside |
| **Magician Language** (Use) | transform, change, possible, imagine, finally, what if, become, unlock, discover |
| **ADHD-Specific** (Use) | your brain, works for you, built for ADHD, designed differently, makes sense for you |
| **Clinical Distance** (Avoid) | patient, treatment, intervention, compliance, disorder, symptoms, manage |
| **Toxic Positivity** (Avoid) | just, simply, easy, anyone can, no excuses |
| **Hierarchy** (Avoid) | you should, you need to, you must, let me tell you, the right way |
| **Hype** (Avoid) | revolutionary, game-changing, miracle, cure, hack, optimize, crush it |
| **Shame-Adjacent** (Avoid) | normal, why can't you, try harder |

### Tagline

Our tagline is a simple, honest acknowledgment of our user's reality and our role in it. It does not promise miracles. It does not minimize the difficulty. It meets the user where they are and offers something real.

> **Life with ADHD is hard. We make it easier.**

---

## 5. Our Brand in Action

This section provides practical guidance on how to apply the Remmi brand to real-world design and communication challenges. It bridges the gap between brand strategy and product execution.

### UI/UX Branding Guidance

Our UI/UX is the most tangible expression of our brand promise. For a voice-activated AI companion targeting executive dysfunction, the interface is not just a container for features; it is the environment in which the relationship between Remmi and the user unfolds. Every design decision must serve the brand principles.

#### Core UX Principles

**Clarity Over Clutter.** The interface must be exceptionally simple and clear. For users with executive dysfunction, cognitive load is the enemy. Every element on the screen must have a clear purpose. If it does not directly help the user, it should not be there. White space is not wasted space; it is breathing room for the ADHD brain.

**Gentle Guidance, Not Rigid Rules.** The app should guide users, not command them. Use soft nudges, gentle reminders, and flexible structures. Avoid aggressive notifications, rigid deadlines, and language that implies failure. The user is always in control. The system adapts to them, not the other way around.

**Celebrate Small Wins.** The journey of managing ADHD is built on small, consistent steps. Acknowledge and celebrate progress, no matter how small. Use positive reinforcement, rewarding animations, and encouraging messages to build momentum and self-efficacy. A completed task is not just checked off; it is a moment of triumph.

**Create a Safe Space.** The UI must feel like a safe, non-judgmental space. This means forgiving user errors, allowing for easy undos, and using language that is supportive and understanding. There is no room for shame, pressure, or guilt in the design.

**From Calm to Magic.** The default state of the app should be calm and serene (the Caregiver). Moments of interaction, completion, and insight should introduce a touch of "magic" (the Magician) through subtle animation, color shifts, and sound. The transition from calm to magic should feel earned and natural, never forced.

#### The Role of the Mascot in the UI

Remmi is not just a logo; Remmi is the user's companion within the application. The mascot should be integrated thoughtfully to build an emotional connection without becoming noise.

| Context | How Remmi Appears |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Onboarding** | Remmi guides the user through setup, introducing features with warmth. Expression: Happy or Encouraging. |
| **Empty States** | Remmi fills empty screens with encouragement. "All done for today! Time to relax." Expression: Calm. |
| **Task Completion** | Remmi celebrates with the user. Expression: Celebrating. |
| **Gentle Nudges** | Remmi delivers reminders as a friend, not a system. Expression: Encouraging. |
| **Loading States** | Remmi's inner glow gently pulses, making the wait feel less frustrating. Expression: Thinking. |
| **Voice Input Active** | Remmi leans in, attentive. Expression: Listening. |

**Mascot Usage Rules:** Do not overuse Remmi. Its appearances should be meaningful. If the mascot is everywhere, it becomes noise. Always ensure Remmi's expression matches the context. Never allow the mascot to obstruct the user from completing their primary action.

#### UI Concept Mockups

The following mockups demonstrate how the brand translates into actual product screens.

![Onboarding Screen](/home/ubuntu/project/ui_mockup_onboarding.png)

The onboarding screen introduces Remmi on a Midnight Blue background. The mascot is prominent and welcoming, with a clear, warm headline and a single Coral Spark CTA. The design is simple, focused, and immediately establishes the emotional tone of the product.

![Dashboard Screen](/home/ubuntu/project/ui_mockup_dashboard.png)

The daily dashboard uses a Cloud White background for calm readability. Tasks are presented in clean cards with generous spacing. Remmi appears in the Celebrating expression next to a completed task, providing positive reinforcement without cluttering the interface.

![Empty State Screen](/home/ubuntu/project/ui_mockup_empty_state.png)

The empty state transforms a potentially negative moment ("nothing to do") into a positive, rewarding one. Remmi is shown in a calm, meditative pose, and the message is encouraging rather than empty. A secondary CTA allows the user to add a new task if they choose.

### Digital Design System

The design system provides the building blocks for creating a consistent and beautiful user experience across all Remmi products.

#### Component Guidelines

| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Button** | Coral Spark (#FF6B6B) background, Cloud White text, fully rounded corners (pill shape), generous padding (16px vertical, 32px horizontal) |
| **Secondary Button** | Cloud White background, Slate Grey border and text, same rounded shape |
| **Tertiary Button** | Text only in Slate Grey, used for less important actions |
| **Cards** | Cloud White background, subtle drop shadow or soft border, rounded corners (12px), generous internal padding (16px+) |
| **Input Fields** | Clean container with Slate Grey border. On focus, border transitions to Amber Glow for a warm, positive affordance |
| **Icons** | Simple, line-based, rounded corners, consistent stroke width. Instantly recognizable and clear |
| **Dividers** | Subtle, light grey lines. Never heavy or dark |

#### Motion and Animation Principles

All motion in the Remmi product should feel organic, gentle, and purposeful. It should never be jarring, fast, or aggressive.

| Element | Guidance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UI Transitions** | Soft ease-in-out timing (300-400ms). Fade transitions preferred over slides or bounces. |
| **Micro-interactions** | Subtle and delightful. A completed checkbox triggers a small burst of Amber Glow particles. A button press has a gentle scale-down effect. |
| **Mascot Animation** | Fluid and organic. The inner glow pulses gently. The body has a subtle squash-and-stretch. Transitions between expressions are smooth, never snapping. |
| **Loading** | Remmi's inner glow pulses rhythmically. No spinning wheels or progress bars where possible. |

## 6. Healthcare Deployment Strategy

Our primary distribution channel for 2026 is healthcare providers: clinics, psychiatrists, and health systems. The brand archetype describes the product-user relationship, not the sales relationship. In B2B contexts, we adapt how we communicate about the brand, not the brand itself.

### Tiered Brand Presentation

| Audience | Visual Identity | Mascot Usage | Messaging Tone | Primary Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Patients / End-Users** | Full brand, all colors, full expression | Front and center, fully expressive | Caregiver-Magician, warm and personal | Compassionate companionship, making life easier |
| **Healthcare Providers** | Full brand, professional emphasis | Logo lockup only; mascot represents patient experience | More Sage energy: evidence, data, outcomes | Patient engagement, care extension, clinical validation |
| **Institutions / Payers** | Wordmark only, Midnight Blue and Cloud White | Not used | Professional, data-driven, formal | Integration, security, compliance, ROI |

### B2B Core Message

> **Remmi is an evidence-based digital companion that delivers measurable improvements in daily functioning for adults with ADHD, extending your care beyond the consultation.**

### Key B2B Messages

| Message | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Patient Outcomes** | Transformative support that measurably improves emotional regulation, daily organization, and habit formation. |
| **Care Extension** | Daily companionship and coaching that reinforces treatment plans between appointments. |
| **Evidence-Based** | Purpose-built based on clinical research and designed specifically for the ADHD brain. |
| **Easy Integration** | Simple to recommend, easy for patients to adopt, minimal friction for clinical workflows. |
| **Ethical Alignment** | No dark patterns, no exploitation. Built by people with ADHD for people with ADHD. |

### Provider Communication Tone

When communicating with healthcare providers, the Caregiver archetype shifts from Companion to Guardian. The tone becomes: "We help you deliver better care. We extend your support beyond the consultation room. We are your partner in patient outcomes." The Magician archetype shifts to Transformation Backed by Proof, leading with data and clinical validation rather than emotional storytelling.

## Closing

> "With the right scaffolding, neurodivergent people have an equal chance at being happy and successful."

This playbook is more than a set of guidelines. It is a commitment. A commitment to the people who use Remmi, to the healthcare providers who recommend it, and to the mission that drives everything we do. Every color, every word, every pixel should serve one purpose: to make someone's life with ADHD a little bit easier.

Remmi is not just a product. Remmi is a companion. And this playbook ensures that companion shows up consistently, authentically, and with genuine care, every single time.

*Remmi Brand Playbook v1.0 | February 2026*
