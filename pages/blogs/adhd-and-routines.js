            How to build habits and routines with ADHD? This is a burning question on the lips of every ADHDer: &quot;How do I build habits with ADHD&quot;. Or maybe you weren&apos;t even aware that it was harder for you with ADHD and just thought you were broken? Well, either way... we&apos;re gonna deep dive into the relationship between ADHD and habits/routines.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="blog-subheader">What is ADHD?</h2>
          <p className="blog-body">
            In short, something that connects most adults with ADHD is struggling to juggle things mentally. Whether we&apos;re juggling tasks, events, or even just remembering to take tonight&apos;s dinner out of the freezer to defrost, we get mentally overwhelmed WAY faster than the average, neurotypical person.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            So, for many of us, ADHD presents itself as chaos because we tend not to have enough mental capacity to act out of rational thinking, so instead we often rely on how we feel.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            This is where difficulty forming habits comes in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="blog-subheader">Why are habits hard to form with ADHD?</h2>
          <p className="blog-body">
            As mentioned above, ADHD causes a massive reduction in mental capacity to act and think rationally, so instead we often rely on how we feel. This doesn&apos;t sound so bad - but it means that controlling our behaviors is really difficult and so, we don&apos;t have much luck forming habits (spoiler: there is hope!)
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Let me paint a picture that might resemble your attempt at building habits as an adult with ADHD:
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            You have a goal to get more fit. You know that to achieve this you should go to the gym. So, you want to build two habits in particular - exercise regularly and eat healthily.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Well... now imagine you&apos;re having a long day at work. You&apos;ve got loads on your plate. You feel mentally overwhelmed and you&apos;re out of capacity to make any more rational decisions.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            You go to the fridge for something to eat and see two options:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside blog-body">
            <li>One healthy option that takes 10 mins to prepare.</li>
            <li>One unhealthy processed food that you can eat right away.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="blog-body">
            You, obviously, take the unhealthy option because you don&apos;t have the mental capacity to remember act with your goals in mind at that moment. Impulsivity takes over and you don&apos;t even have the chance to make that intervention.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            This is where our ADHD fails most of us in building habits. Even when we have a super clear goal, we act impulsively before those goals and that rational thought process even gets a chance to have a say.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Seems impossible to prevent, right? Well... it&apos;s not. Here&apos;s how to conquer that.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="blog-subheader">How to form habits with ADHD:</h2>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">1. Get slapped in the face by your &apos;why&apos;</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Having a really strong &apos;why&apos; and constantly reminding yourself of that why is crucial. Your &apos;why&apos; is the deeply personal reason behind your desire to form a new habit. For example, if you want to exercise regularly, your &apos;why&apos; might be &quot;I want to be healthy enough to play actively with my kids as they grow up.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            To make your &apos;why&apos; effective:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside blog-body">
            <li>Write it down and place it somewhere you&apos;ll see it daily (e.g., bathroom mirror, phone wallpaper).</li>
            <li>Create a vision board with images representing your &apos;why&apos;.</li>
            <li>Set daily reminders on your phone to reflect on your &apos;why&apos;.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">2. Start ridiculously small</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            When it comes to habit formation with ADHD, think microscopic. Instead of &quot;I&apos;ll exercise for an hour every day,&quot; start with &quot;I&apos;ll do one push-up a day.&quot; This might seem too easy, but that&apos;s the point. It&apos;s so small that your brain won&apos;t resist it, making it easier to overcome the initial inertia.
          </p>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">3. Use visual cues and reminders</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            ADHD brains often struggle with working memory. Combat this by using visual cues:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside blog-body">
            <li>Set out your gym clothes the night before.</li>
            <li>Use colorful sticky notes as reminders.</li>
            <li>Create a habit tracker on a large calendar where you can see your progress.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">4. Leverage your hyperfocus</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            While ADHD can make it hard to focus on boring tasks, it can also lead to intense focus on interesting ones. Use this to your advantage:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside blog-body">
            <li>Find ways to make your new habit engaging or fun.</li>
            <li>Gamify your habit-building process.</li>
            <li>Use apps or technology that you find interesting to track your progress.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">5. Build a support system</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Tell friends, family, or an online community about your habit goals. Having external accountability can provide the extra push you need on tough days.
          </p>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">6. Prepare for setbacks</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            With ADHD, it&apos;s common to have good days and bad days. Prepare for this by:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside blog-body">
            <li>Having a &quot;if-then&quot; plan for obstacles. (e.g., &quot;If I miss a day at the gym, then I&apos;ll do a 10-minute home workout.&quot;)</li>
            <li>Practicing self-compassion. Remember, progress isn&apos;t linear.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">7. Use the &apos;body doubling&apos; technique</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            This ADHD-friendly strategy involves having someone else present (either physically or virtually) while you work on your habit. Their presence can help keep you accountable and focused.
          </p>
          <h3 className="blog-subheader-small">8. Capitalize on your &apos;good&apos; days</h3>
          <p className="blog-body">
            When you&apos;re having a day where your symptoms are less severe, use that energy to set up systems that will help you on your harder days. This might involve meal prepping, organizing your space, or planning your week.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="blog-subheader">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Building habits with ADHD is challenging, but it&apos;s far from impossible. By understanding how your ADHD brain works and implementing these strategies, you can create lasting change. Remember, it&apos;s about progress, not perfection. Celebrate your wins, learn from your setbacks, and keep moving forward. With time and persistence, you can build the habits and routines that will help you thrive with ADHD.
