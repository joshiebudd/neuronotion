              How to build habits and routines with ADHD?
              <br />
              <br />
              This is a burning question on the lips of every ADHDer: <b>&quot;How do I build habits with ADHD&quot;.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Or maybe you weren&apos;t even aware that it was harder for you with ADHD and just thought you were broken?
              <br />
              <br />
              Well, either way... we&apos;re gonna deep dive into the <b>relationship between ADHD and habits/routines.</b>
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 className="blog-subheader">What is ADHD? üß†</h2>
            <p className="blog-body">
              In short, something that connects most adults with ADHD is <b>struggling to juggle things mentally.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Whether we&apos;re juggling tasks, events, or even just remembering to take tonight&apos;s dinner out of the freezer to defrost, we get <b>mentally overwhelmed WAY faster than the average, neurotypical person</b>.
              <br />
              <br />
              So, for many of us, ADHD presents itself as<i> chaos </i>because we tend not to have enough mental capacity to act out of rational thinking, so instead we often rely on how we feel.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is where difficulty forming habits comes in.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 className="blog-subheader">Why are habits hard to form with ADHD? üòµ‚Äçüí´</h2>
            <p className="blog-body">
              As mentioned above, ADHD causes a massive reduction in mental capacity to act and think rationally, so instead <b>we often rely on how we feel when we act.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              This doesn&apos;t sound so bad - but it means that controlling our behaviors is really difficult and so, we don&apos;t have much luck forming habits (spoiler: there is hope!)
              <br />
              <br />
<b>              Let me paint a picture that might resemble your attempt at building habits as an adult with ADHD üëÅÔ∏è
</b>              <br />
              <br />
              You have a goal to get more fit.
              <br />
              <br />
              You know that to achieve this you should go to the gym.
              <br />
              <br />
              So, you want to build <b>two habits in particular:</b>
              <br />
              ‚Üí exercise regularly
              <br />
              ‚Üí and eat healthily.
              <br />
              <br />
              Well... now imagine you&apos;re having a long day at work.
              <br />
              <br />
              You&apos;ve got loads on your plate.
              <br />
              <br />
              You feel mentally overwhelmed and you&apos;re out of capacity to make any more rational decisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              You go to the fridge for something to eat and see two options:
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ One healthy option that takes 10 mins to prepare.
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ One unhealthy processed food that you can eat right away.
              <br />
              <br />
              You, obviously, take the unhealthy option because <b>you don&apos;t have the mental capacity to remember act with your goals in mind</b> at that moment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Impulsivity of ADHD takes over and you don&apos;t even have the chance to make that intervention.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is where our ADHD fails most of us in building habits.
              <br />
              <br />
              Even when we have a super clear goal, we act impulsively before those goals and that rational thought process even gets a chance to have a say.
              <br />
              <br />
              Seems impossible to prevent, right? Well... it&apos;s not. Here&apos;s how to conquer that.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 className="blog-subheader">How to form habits with ADHD:</h2>
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">1. Get slapped in the face by your &apos;why&apos;</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              Having a really strong &apos;why&apos; and constantly reminding yourself of that why is crucial.
              <br />
              <br />
              Your &apos;why&apos; is the deeply personal reason behind your desire to form a new habit.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, if you want to exercise regularly, your &apos;why&apos; might be &quot;I want to be healthy enough to play actively with my kids as they grow up.&quot;
              <br />
              <br />
<b>              To make your &apos;why&apos; effective:
</b>              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Write it down and place it somewhere you&apos;ll see it daily (e.g., bathroom mirror, phone wallpaper or for our example - on the fridge).
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Set daily reminders and notifications on your phone to remind you on your &apos;why&apos;.
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Make it absolutely unavoidable to remember the deepest reason for you to build that habit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">2. Start ridiculously small</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              When it comes to habit formation with ADHD, think microscopic. Instead of &quot;I&apos;ll exercise for an hour every day,&quot; start with &quot;I&apos;ll do one push-up a day.&quot;
              <br />
              <br />
              This might seem too easy, but that&apos;s the point. It&apos;s so small that your brain won&apos;t resist it, making it easier to overcome the initial inertia.
              <br />
              <br />
              Then do two the next day etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you fail one day, just do 1 less than the previous day - so its easier.
              <br />
              <br />
              Motivation only lasts a few days with building habits and routines.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once the motivation fades, it needs to be easy to make continuous incremental imporovements.
              <br />
              <br />
<b>              Huge changes DON&apos;T happen overnight!
</b>            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">3. Use visual cues and reminders</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              ADHD brains often struggle with working memory. Combat this by using visual cues:
              <br />
              ‚Üí Set out your gym clothes the night before.
              <br />
              ‚Üí Use colorful sticky notes as reminders.
              <br />
              ‚Üí Use an ADHD friendly habit tracker that is visually appealing (Try the <a href="https://www.neuro-notion.com/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Neuro Notion Free ADHD Routine & Habit Tracker Template</a>)
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">4. Gamify your habits</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              Yes, after 1 week you&apos;ll probably dread the idea of going to the gym. But if you set yourself a specific reward for completing the gym then you have a short-term goal at the end of it.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eventually you&apos;ll form an association between the hard task and the fun reward.
              <br />
              <br />
              This REALLY works.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">5. Prepare for setbacks</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              With ADHD, no one is immune from having &quot;one of those days&quot;. Prepare for this by:
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Having an <b>&quot;if-then&quot;</b> plan for obstacles. (e.g., &quot;If I miss a day at the gym, then I&apos;ll do a 10-minute home workout.&quot;)
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Practicing <b>self-compassion</b>. Remember, progress isn&apos;t linear. Sometimes we take one step back to take two steps forward.
              <br />
              ‚Ä¢ Try not to excuse yourself with this too much but also remember, <b>you&apos;re human</b> - don&apos;t beat yourself up about it!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">6. Capitalize on your &apos;good&apos; days</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              If you&apos;re having a day where your symptoms are less severe, use that energy to set up systems that will help you on your harder days.
              <br />
              <br />
              This might involve meal prepping, building a system that makes working out easier, or even planning your week. This can be SO energising on those days where you               really need that helping hand.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 className="blog-subheader">7. Body Double!</h3>
            <p className="blog-body">
              All ADHDers know that nothing is more motivating than having someone else to battle through it with.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you know someone else with ADHD who might also want to form this habit:
              <br />
              ‚Üí Organize a system where you keep each other accountable.
              <br />
              ‚Üí Set reminders to check in with each other - take pictures for evidence every time.
              <br />
              ‚Üí You can even do this virtually with strangers in <a href="https://discord.gg/6drDpUnYVG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communities</a>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 className="blog-subheader">Conclusion ‚òÅÔ∏è</h2>
            <p className="blog-body">
              Building habits with ADHD is challenging, but it&apos;s far from impossible.
              <br />
              <br />
              By understanding how your ADHD brain works and implementing these strategies, you can create lasting change.
              <br />
              <br />
              Remember, it&apos;s about progress, not perfection.
              <br />
              <br />
              Celebrate your wins, learn from your setbacks, and keep moving forward.
