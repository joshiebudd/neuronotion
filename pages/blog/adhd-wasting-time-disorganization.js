                Here&apos;s what makes this particularly brutal for ADHD brains: you&apos;re stuck in a vicious cycle.

Then poor sleep amplifies every ADHD symptom, making the next night&apos;s sleep even harder.

                <li>Your ADHD makes it hard to fall asleep (racing thoughts, delayed sleep phase, restlessness)</li>
                <li>You get 5-6 hours instead of 8</li>
                <li>Your executive function, already impaired, becomes nearly non-existent</li>
                <li>You make poor decisions all day (food, focus, emotional regulation)</li>
                <li>The stress and overwhelm from a dysfunctional day make falling asleep even harder</li>

                This is why you can&apos;t just &quot;try harder&quot; with ADHD. When you&apos;re sleep deprived, your brain literally doesn&apos;t have the resources to function properly. Willpower can&apos;t compensate for neurological depletion.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your prefrontal cortex—the part responsible for executive function, impulse control, and emotional regulation—is already underactive with ADHD. Sleep deprivation makes it even less functional.

              <p className="blog-body">
                A neurotypical person with 6 hours of sleep might be slightly less productive. You with 6 hours of sleep? You can barely function. Tasks that were manageable yesterday become impossible today. Your emotional regulation disappears. Your impulsivity skyrockets.

              <p className="blog-body">
                With ADHD, relying on willpower to go to bed &quot;on time&quot; doesn&apos;t work. You need structure that makes good sleep the default.

              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Set a &quot;bedtime alarm&quot;:</strong> Not just a wake-up alarm. An alarm that reminds you when to start your shutdown routine.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove high-stimulation devices from your bed area:</strong> If your phone is where you sleep, your brain will associate bed with stimulation, not rest.</li>
                <li><strong>Use automation:</strong> Smart lights dimming at certain times, do not disturb turning on, apps locking you out late at night.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Optimise the Environment for Sensory Comfort</h3>
              <p className="blog-body">
                ADHD often comes with sensory sensitivities. Your sleep environment matters more than you think:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cooler rooms promote better sleep—around 18-20°C is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Light:</strong> Blackout curtains or eye masks help signal &quot;night mode&quot; to your brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Sound:</strong> White noise, fans, or earplugs can reduce auditory distractions. Your sensory sensitivity makes this crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit screens 1 hour before bed:</strong> Blue light delays melatonin production, making your already-delayed sleep phase even worse.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise earlier in the day:</strong> Provides natural dopamine and helps with regulation, but too close to bedtime can be activating.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="blog-subheader">Sleep Isn&apos;t Optional</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                I&apos;ll say it again: improving sleep with ADHD is not just another wellness tip. It&apos;s THE foundation everything else builds on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                You can have the best productivity systems, the perfect routine, the most supportive tools—but if you&apos;re sleep deprived, none of it will work. Your brain simply won&apos;t have the resources to execute.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Conversely, when you prioritize sleep, everything else becomes easier. Your focus improves. Your emotional regulation strengthens. Your executive function returns. Your impulse control increases. Your decision-making sharpens.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This isn&apos;t about being perfect. You&apos;ll have bad sleep nights. Life happens. What matters is making sleep a non-negotiable priority most nights.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Because when you consistently get 7-8 hours, you&apos;re not just managing your ADHD symptoms—you&apos;re giving your brain the basic resource it needs to function. Everything else flows from that foundation.
