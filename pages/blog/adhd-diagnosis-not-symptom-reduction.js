              <p className="blog-body">
                Whether you&apos;re diagnosed, seeking diagnosis, or just suspect ADHD, here&apos;s what actually makes a difference:

              <br />
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Learn How Your Brain Works</h3>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Read about ADHD. Watch videos. Join communities. Understand the neuroscience. Learn why you do what you do.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This isn&apos;t about self-diagnosis for internet points. It&apos;s about understanding yourself so you can work WITH your brain instead of against it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Build External Systems</h3>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your ADHD brain struggles with working memory. So stop trying to remember everything. Externalize it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Use apps. Write things down. Set reminders. Create checklists. Build systems that don&apos;t rely on your memory or executive function.

              <p className="blog-body">
                Not everything will work for you. That&apos;s okay. The goal isn&apos;t perfection—it&apos;s finding what works for YOUR brain.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Try body doubling. Test different productivity methods. Experiment with routines. See what sticks.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The people who manage ADHD best aren&apos;t the ones with perfect systems. They&apos;re the ones who keep trying until they find what works.

              <p className="blog-body">
                You&apos;re not lazy. You&apos;re not stupid. You&apos;re not broken.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your brain works differently. And that&apos;s not a moral failing—it&apos;s neurology.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Stop beating yourself up for struggling with things neurotypical people find easy. Start building systems that accommodate your brain instead of forcing it into neurotypical molds.

              <p className="blog-body">
                Getting an ADHD diagnosis is valuable. It opens doors to medication. It validates your struggles. It helps you understand yourself.

              <br />

              <p className="blog-body">
                If you suspect you have ADHD, absolutely pursue diagnosis. Get on that waitlist. Find a psychiatrist. Do what you need to do.
