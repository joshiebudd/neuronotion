              <h2 className="blog-subheader">1. Quarterly Sprints Instead of Annual Goals</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your ADHD brain processes time differently than neurotypical brains. For us, there are only two time zones:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>NOW</strong> (like, right this second)</li>
                <li><strong>NOT NOW</strong> (might as well be never)</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This is why annual planning feels impossible. A year is &quot;not now&quot; which means your brain categorizes it as &quot;basically irrelevant.&quot; By the time March rolls around, those January goals have vanished into the void.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                90 days is perfect because it&apos;s:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Long enough to achieve something meaningful</li>
                <li>Short enough to maintain focus (it stays in &quot;now&quot; territory)</li>
                <li>Perfect for building momentum before interest wanes</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Pick 2-3 goals for the next 90 days. Not 10. Not a vague list. Two to three specific outcomes you want to achieve. That&apos;s it. Understanding <Link href="/blog/the-adhd-goldilocks-zone-rewrite" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">your ADHD Goldilocks Zone</Link> helps you set goals that challenge without overwhelming.
              </p>

              <br />
              <h2 className="blog-subheader">2. Work Out Your Daily Minimum Wins</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Here&apos;s where most ADHD goal-setting fails: you have a quarterly goal but no daily action plan. Your brain has no idea what to do today to make that goal happen, so you do nothing and feel guilty about it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Break those quarterly goals into tiny, dopamine-friendly daily actions. Work backwards from the goal to figure out what you actually need to do each day for that goal to become reality.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                <strong>Examples of daily minimum wins:</strong>
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Goal: Revenue ($5k/month)</strong> → Daily win: Reach out to 5 potential clients</li>
                <li><strong>Goal: Build new onboarding process</strong> → Daily win: Document one process step</li>
                <li><strong>Goal: Master sales</strong> → Daily win: Study one sales call recording</li>
                <li><strong>Goal: Get healthier</strong> → Daily win: 20-minute walk after breakfast</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Notice these are small, specific, and measurable. Not &quot;work on business.&quot; Not &quot;be healthier.&quot; Concrete actions your ADHD brain can actually execute without overthinking.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The magic happens when you complete these minimum wins consistently. Miss a day? No problem. The system is designed for interruption. Just restart tomorrow. Many people find that when they&apos;re <Link href="/blog/adhd-and-routines" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">building ADHD-friendly routines</Link>, starting small is the only approach that sticks.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2 className="blog-subheader">3. Dopamine Hack Your Reward System</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Here&apos;s a mind-blowing fact: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826767/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">research shows</a> your brain gets more dopamine from <em>anticipating</em> rewards than actually achieving them.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This is wild. And you can use it to your advantage.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                <strong>Create immediate reward loops:</strong>
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Complete 1 hour focused work → 10-minute gaming break</li>
                <li>Finish daily outreach → Coffee shop reward</li>
                <li>Hit weekly goal → Buy that book you&apos;ve been eyeing</li>
                <li>Complete morning routine → Favorite breakfast</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Sounds gimmicky, I know. But it really works for ADHD brains because we need external dopamine sources. Your brain won&apos;t generate reward feelings from completing &quot;boring&quot; tasks, so you create artificial rewards to bridge the gap.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The key is making rewards immediate and specific. &quot;I&apos;ll reward myself eventually&quot; doesn&apos;t work. &quot;After I finish this task, I get 15 minutes of TikTok&quot; does work because your brain can anticipate that specific reward right now.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2 className="blog-subheader">4. Kill Perfectionism—It&apos;s Not a Positive Trait</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Let me be blunt: perfectionism doesn&apos;t mean you have high standards. It probably just means you&apos;re terrified of failing, so you&apos;re too scared to put anything out that might not be incredible.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                I got news for you:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>A messy plan you follow &gt; A perfect plan you don&apos;t</li>
                <li>Starting before you&apos;re ready &gt; Waiting for the &quot;right moment&quot;</li>
                <li>Progress over perfection, always</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                ADHD and perfectionism create a toxic combo. Your brain already struggles with initiation. Add perfectionism on top, and now you can&apos;t start anything unless conditions are perfect (which they never are). This is why understanding <Link href="/blog/adhd-brains-dont-do-small" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">why ADHD brains refuse small tasks</Link> helps—perfectionism is often the hidden barrier.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The antidote? Give yourself explicit permission to suck. Your first draft will be bad. Your first attempt will be clumsy. That&apos;s not failure—that&apos;s how everyone starts. The difference is neurotypical people don&apos;t let it stop them, and neither should you.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2 className="blog-subheader">5. External Accountability is King</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Here&apos;s a stat that blew my mind: ADHDers with accountability partners are <strong>95% more likely</strong> to achieve their goals.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Not a typo. Ninety-five percent.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Why? Because ADHD brains thrive on external motivation:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Deadlines from clients?</strong> We crush them.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular check-ins?</strong> We show up.</li>
                <li><strong>Working alone with no external pressure?</strong> We struggle.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your internal motivation system is unreliable. Accept it. Build external accountability instead:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Find an accountability partner who checks in weekly</li>
                <li>Join a body-doubling session or coworking space</li>
                <li>Use tools like **Claudia by Neuro** that provide consistent external structure</li>
                <li>Post your goals publicly (scary but effective)</li>
                <li>Hire a coach or join a group program</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The key is making it external. Your ADHD brain will let you down. External systems won&apos;t. This isn&apos;t a character flaw—it&apos;s a neurological reality. Stop fighting it and build support around it instead.
              </p>

              <h2 className="blog-subheader">Start Small, Build Momentum</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                Don&apos;t try to implement all five strategies at once. That&apos;s a recipe for overwhelm and abandonment. Pick ONE that resonates most and commit to it for the next 30 days.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                For most people with ADHD, I recommend starting with #2 (Daily Minimum Wins) because it creates immediate, tangible progress. Once that feels sustainable, layer in the reward system (#3). Then add accountability (#5).
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                The goal isn&apos;t perfection. It&apos;s progress. It&apos;s taking control one day at a time, one small win at a time, until suddenly you look back and realize you&apos;ve built momentum you never thought possible with ADHD.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                You are not broken. Your ADHD is not a life sentence of chaos and underachievement. You just need systems designed for how your brain actually works, not how society thinks it should work.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
