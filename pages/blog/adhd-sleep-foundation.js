              <p className="blog-body">
                Here&apos;s something most people don&apos;t talk about: sleep deprivation doesn&apos;t just make you tired. It gives your brain an excuse to make poor decisions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                When you&apos;re sleep deprived, your brain essentially says: &quot;Well, I&apos;m exhausted, so I DESERVE that dopamine hit from junk food / social media / impulse purchase / whatever.&quot;
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                It&apos;s not just that your impulse control is lowered. It&apos;s that your brain actively justifies poor choices because &quot;you&apos;re tired.&quot;
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />

                This is particularly devastating for ADHD brains because:

                <li>Your impulse control is already compromised</li>
                <li>Your dopamine-seeking behavior is already intense</li>
                <li>Your executive function is already limited</li>

              <p className="blog-body">
                Add sleep deprivation on top, and you&apos;re not just fighting ADHD—you&apos;re fighting ADHD with one hand tied behind your back and weights attached to your ankles.

                Just get some paper (or use an ADHD-friendly journal template) and offload everything from your brain onto the page. You&apos;ll sleep like a princess.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This works because your ADHD brain is holding onto hundreds of thoughts, worries, and tasks. Your working memory is overloaded. By externalizing all of it onto paper, you signal to your brain that it&apos;s safe to release those thoughts. They&apos;re captured. You won&apos;t forget them.
              </p>
              <br />

                <strong>Claudia by Neuro</strong> can help with this through quick brain dumps before bed. Instead of lying awake worrying about everything you need to remember, you dump it all into the system in 60 seconds. Your brain can finally relax because the thoughts are safely stored externally.

              <p className="blog-body">
                Beyond journaling, here are other evidence-based strategies that help ADHD brains sleep better:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Respect your delayed circadian rhythm:</strong> Many ADHD brains naturally want to sleep later. If possible, adjust your schedule rather than fighting your biology.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a cool sleep environment:</strong> Optimal temperature is 65-68°F. Your ADHD brain is more sensitive to environmental factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Use white/brown noise:</strong> Masks intrusive sounds that wake you. Your sensory sensitivity makes this crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit screens 1 hour before bed:</strong> Blue light delays melatonin production, making your already-delayed sleep phase even worse.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise earlier in the day:</strong> Provides natural dopamine and helps with regulation, but too close to bedtime can be activating.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2 className="blog-subheader">Sleep Isn&apos;t Optional</h2>
              <p className="blog-body">
                I&apos;ll say it again: improving sleep with ADHD is not just another wellness tip. It&apos;s THE foundation everything else builds on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                You can have the best productivity systems, the perfect routine, the most supportive tools—but if you&apos;re sleep deprived, none of it will work. Your brain simply won&apos;t have the resources to execute.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Conversely, when you prioritize sleep, everything else becomes easier. Your focus improves. Your emotional regulation strengthens. Your executive function returns. Your impulse control increases. Your decision-making sharpens.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This isn&apos;t about being perfect. You&apos;ll have bad sleep nights. Life happens. What matters is making sleep a non-negotiable priority most nights.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Because when you consistently get 7-8 hours, you&apos;re not just managing your ADHD symptoms—you&apos;re giving your brain the basic resource it needs to function. Everything else flows from that foundation.
