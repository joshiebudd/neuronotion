                Here&apos;s what makes this particularly brutal for ADHD brains: you&apos;re stuck in a vicious cycle.
              </p>

Then poor sleep amplifies every ADHD symptom, making the next night&apos;s sleep even harder.

              <br />
              <br />

              <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Your ADHD makes it hard to fall asleep (racing thoughts, delayed sleep phase, restlessness)</li>
                <li>You get 5-6 hours instead of 8</li>
                <li>Your executive function, already impaired, becomes nearly non-existent</li>
                <li>You make poor decisions all day (food, focus, emotional regulation)</li>
                <li>The stress and overwhelm from a dysfunctional day make falling asleep even harder</li>

                This is why you can&apos;t just "try harder" with ADHD. When you&apos;re sleep deprived, your brain literally doesn&apos;t have the resources to function properly. Willpower can&apos;t compensate for neurological depletion.

                Everyone struggles with poor sleep. But for ADHD brains, the impact is exponentially worse.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Your prefrontal cortex—the part responsible for executive function, impulse control, and emotional regulation—is already underactive with ADHD. Sleep deprivation makes it even less functional.

              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                A neurotypical person with 6 hours of sleep might be slightly less productive. You with 6 hours of sleep? You can barely function. Tasks that were manageable yesterday become impossible today. Your emotional regulation disappears. Your impulsivity skyrockets.

                Just get some paper (or use an ADHD-friendly journal template) and offload everything from your brain onto the page. You&apos;ll sleep like a princess.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This works because your ADHD brain is holding onto hundreds of thoughts, worries, and tasks. Your working memory is overloaded. By externalizing all of it onto paper, you signal to your brain that it&apos;s safe to release those thoughts. They&apos;re captured. You won&apos;t forget them.
              </p>

                <strong>Claudia by Neuro</strong> can help with this through quick brain dumps before bed. Instead of lying awake worrying about everything you need to remember, you dump it all into the system in 60 seconds. Your brain can finally relax because the thoughts are safely stored externally.

              <p className="blog-body">
                Beyond journaling, here are other evidence-based strategies that help ADHD brains sleep better:
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li><strong>Respect your delayed circadian rhythm:</strong> Many ADHD brains naturally want to sleep later. If possible, adjust your schedule rather than fighting your biology.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a cool sleep environment:</strong> Optimal temperature is 65-68°F. Your ADHD brain is more sensitive to environmental factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Use white/brown noise:</strong> Masks intrusive sounds that wake you. Your sensory sensitivity makes this crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit screens 1 hour before bed:</strong> Blue light delays melatonin production, making your already-delayed sleep phase even worse.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise earlier in the day:</strong> Provides natural dopamine and helps with regulation, but too close to bedtime can be activating.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="blog-body">
                I&apos;ll say it again: improving sleep with ADHD is not just another wellness tip. It&apos;s THE foundation everything else builds on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                You can have the best productivity systems, the perfect routine, the most supportive tools—but if you&apos;re sleep deprived, none of it will work. Your brain simply won&apos;t have the resources to execute.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Conversely, when you prioritize sleep, everything else becomes easier. Your focus improves. Your emotional regulation strengthens. Your executive function returns. Your impulse control increases. Your decision-making sharpens.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                This isn&apos;t about being perfect. You&apos;ll have bad sleep nights. Life happens. What matters is making sleep a non-negotiable priority most nights.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Because when you consistently get 7-8 hours, you&apos;re not just managing your ADHD symptoms—you&apos;re giving your brain the basic resource it needs to function. Everything else flows from that foundation.
