                Over the course of 8 years from then, I obsessively learned about how ADHD affects every facet of my life (and it does affect every single area!).

                So if your ADHD is causing you to:

              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Struggle with getting &quot;simple&quot; stuff done</li>
                <li>Making you feel swamped by things you&apos;ve gotta do</li>
                <li>Controlling you rather than the other way round…</li>
              </ul>

                You&apos;ve gotta do two things:

              <p className="blog-body">
                Get your hands on absolutely everything you can and become an expert of how your own brain works.

              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Not ADHD in general. YOUR ADHD specifically.

              <br />
              <br />
              <p className="blog-body">
                Read books. Watch videos. Join communities. Try strategies. Pay attention to what works and what doesn&apos;t. Keep a running log of your patterns.

              <p className="blog-body">
                Once you understand how your brain works, build or adopt systems designed for that brain.

              <ul className="list-disc ml-8 blog-body">
                <li>Externalizing ALL working memory (nothing stays in my head)</li>
                <li>Building routines that autopilot executive function</li>
                <li>Creating environments that remove decision fatigue</li>
                <li>Using tools that capture thoughts instantly</li>
                <li>Scheduling based on energy types, not arbitrary time blocks</li>

                These systems work FOR my ADHD, not against it.
