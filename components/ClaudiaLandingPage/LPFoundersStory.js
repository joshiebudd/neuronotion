                Hi, I&apos;m [Founder Name], and I&apos;ve lived with ADHD my entire life. Like you, I&apos;ve tried every productivity system, app, and &quot;life hack&quot; out there. Most were built by neurotypical minds for neurotypical brains.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
                After years of struggling with traditional productivity methods that just didn&apos;t work for my ADHD brain, I decided to build something different. Something that actually understands how we think, process information, and get things done.
              </p>
